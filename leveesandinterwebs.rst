Mapping levees and their stability using the interwebs
=====================================================

In the Netherlands water security is probably the major water issue the country faces. As 60% of the country and around 80% of the population is located below sea level, this becomes an issue of national security. 

To monitor these levees in the year 2013 it no longer suffices to send people around to the dikes themselves. The levees are now equipped with all kinds of sensors as can be seen in the image below. Sensors are embedded in the levee to make an intelligent artifact.

As a datum the IJkdijk foundation built a levee with all kinds of sensors that could and has been breached without any real danger. The data the sensors ended up now serves as a baseline (IJkdijk is Dutch for: Calibration Levee).

If all levees are to be equipped with these sensors this will result in mountains of data to keep track of. This is what we built a big platform around at where I work (http://nelen-schuurmans.nl). To facilitate the sensors that all lock into sockets or upload stuff to some server, we collect the data and display it.
